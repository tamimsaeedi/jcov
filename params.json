Also the default command (just type 'jcov')\r\n+ **jcov check**: Check the configuration.\r\n+ **jcov help**: Show help docs.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlobal Options:\r\n```\r\n-c, --config FILE    Specify a configuration file to use \r\n-h, --help           Display help documentation \r\n-v, --version        Display version information \r\n-t, --trace          Display backtrace when an error occurs \r\n```\r\n\r\nRun Options:\r\n```\r\n-t, --test REGEX     Limit the tests to only the ones that match the regular expression \r\n--verbose            Verbose test execution \r\n--[no-]color         Enable/Disable color output -- default enabled when executed from the command-line \r\n--[no-]coverage      Enable/Disable coverage output -- default enabled \r\n--report             Report test coverage \r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning with the `--report` switch will output an HTML coverage report that shows line-by-line coverage.\r\n\r\nIf your testing framework supports color output your runner file must pass the color boolean value from the JCov object (`JCov.options.color`) to the framework (see the Jasmine and JCov examples).\r\n\r\nThe `--verbose` switch is another option your framework must support (see the JCov example).\r\n\r\nRun will also return with a non-zero code when the tests don't pass so it can be easily integrated into continuous integration suites.\r\n\r\n### jcov.yaml\r\nConfigure JCov by creating a jcov.yaml file.\r\nJCov also has some \"intelligent\" defaults and you can see the how the jcov.yaml file works with those defaults using the check command to output the combined configuration:\r\n\r\n```\r\njcov check\r\n```\r\n\r\nJCov will look for the jcov.yaml file in a `config` directory and the current directory.\r\n\r\nExample jcov check output:\r\n```\r\nUsing configuration file: ./jcov.yml\r\n--- \r\ntest_directory: tests\r\nsource_directory: javascripts\r\ntest_runner: jasmine/runner.js\r\nerror_field: results\r\nreport_output_directory: jcov\r\nignore: \r\n- jasmine\r\n- tests\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Configuration Keys\r\n\r\n`test_directory`: Where the test files are kept. (Default *test/javascripts*)\r\n`source_directory`: Where the source files are kept. (Default *public/javascripts*)\r\n`test_runner`: The Javascript file JCov executes to run your tests. (Default *test/javascripts/runner.js*)\r\n`error_field`: The Javascript variable that JCov examines to find out how many failures occurred while running the test suite. (Default *error_count*)\r\n`report_output_directory`: Where the HTML coverage reports will be written. (Default *jcov*)\r\n\r\n### Runner Files\r\n\r\nYou will need a Javascript runner file to tell JCov how to run your tests.\r\nThis is usually a simple script that loads your testing framework, the source and test files, and calls whatever `execute()` method your framework needs. After the tests are run it needs to This is intentionally left open to make it easier for JCov to support arbitrary frameworks.\r\n\r\nSee the examples directory for examples.\r\n\r\n#### Runner API\r\n\r\nJCov provides some methods and a data object to the runner file.\r\n\r\n- The JCov object\r\n  - `JCov.tests`: An Array of tests to execute (the list of everything from your test directory filtered by the `--test` switch)\r\n  - `JCov.config`: The configuration loaded from jcov.yaml (see above)\r\n  - `JCov.options`: Passed in command line options (see above)\r\n\r\n- Global Methods\r\n  - `print()`: Print to the console.\r\n  - `println()`: Print to the console with a carriage return.\r\n  - `load()`: load and execute the given file.\r\n  - `readFile()`: load file and return it as a string.\r\n  - `putc()`: Print a single character to the console.\r\n\r\n### Headless Browser Testing\r\n\r\nHeadless browser testing can be supported with something like the [env.js project](https://github.com/thatcher/env-js) which mimics the browser/DOM interface in a pure Javascript way.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) YP Intellectual Property, LLC 2012.
